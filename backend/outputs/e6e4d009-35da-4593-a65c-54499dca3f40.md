<think>Got it, let's tackle this conversion. The user provided text from a PDF page about the Transformer paper. I need to convert it into clean Markdown, following the specified rules.

First, check for tables: there are no tables in this text. So we don't need to handle tables.

Next, code blocks: there's no explicit code block in the text. So we can skip that.

Math: No mathematical equations detected, so no LaTeX needed.

Structure: The text has headers like "Attention Is All You Need", then author information, abstract, etc. We need to preserve the structure with proper Markdown formatting.

Let's go through each part:

- The first paragraph about Google granting permission: that should be a regular paragraph.
- Then the title "Attention Is All You Need"
- Authors with affiliations and emails: these should be listed as is, preserving the author lines.
- Abstract section: start with "Abstract" as a heading (maybe ## Abstract? Wait, the original text has "Abstract" in all caps. So we can use ## Abstract.
- Then the abstract content: paragraphs as they are, preserving line breaks where necessary. But in Markdown, we can just use regular paragraph tags.
- Then the authors' contributions section: that's a long paragraph with details about each author. We need to keep that as is.
- Then the footnotes: † and ‡, we can format them with superscripts if needed. But in Markdown, we can use the symbols as they are.
- Finally, the conference and arXiv info.

Now, let's structure each part:

1. The first paragraph about Google permission: keep as is.
2. Title "Attention Is All You Need" – use ## for main heading, maybe bold? The original text has the title in a larger font, so we can use ## for that.
3. Authors list: each author on a new line with affiliation and email. We can keep them as separate lines.
4. Abstract heading: ## Abstract
5. Abstract content: paragraphs as they are, preserving the flow.
6. Authors' contributions paragraph: keep as is.
7. Footnotes († and ‡): format them with appropriate superscript if needed, but in the original text they are just symbols. So we can keep them as † and ‡.
8. Conference and arXiv info: keep as is.

Now, let's write the Markdown:

First paragraph:
Provided proper attribution is provided, Google hereby grants permission to
reproduce the tables and figures in this paper solely for use in journalistic or

Then title:

## Abstract
The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or
convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best
performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention
mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,
based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions
entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to
be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly
less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-
to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including
ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,
our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after
training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the
best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to
other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with
large and limited training data.

<think>Got it, let's tackle this. The user provided a text from page 2 of a paper, and we need to convert it into clean Markdown as per the instructions.

First, let's parse the content. The text starts with "1 Introduction" as a header. Then there's a lot of paragraphs about recurrent neural networks, attention mechanisms, and the Transformer model.

We need to structure this properly. The headers are numbered (1 Introduction), then 2 Background, etc. So we should keep the numbering.

Now, let's go through each section:

- The first part is "1 Introduction". Then the text about RNNs, attention, etc.

- Next section is "2 Background", which talks about other models like Extended Neural GPU, ByteNet, etc.

- Then "3 Model Architecture" starts with the encoder-decoder structure.

Now, we need to format this into Markdown. Let's check for code blocks or math—there don't seem to be any in this text, except maybe some references like [13], but those are just citations.

So we need to preserve the structure, headers, and paragraphs. Let's make sure the numbering is correct (1 Introduction, 2 Background, etc.).

Now, let's write out the Markdown:

First, "1 Introduction" as a header. Then the paragraphs about RNNs, attention, Transformer.

Then "2 Background" as a header. Then the paragraphs about other models and their limitations, then how Transformer addresses that.

Then "3 Model Architecture" as a header. Then the paragraphs about encoder-decoder structure, auto-regressive generation.

Now, we need to ensure that the flow is correct. For example, after "1 Introduction", the text starts with "Recurrent neural networks..." So we need to keep that flow.

Also, check for any bold or italic text. The provided text doesn't have any bold/italic formatting except maybe the headers, which are already numbered.

Now, putting it all together in Markdown format.</think>

1 Introduction
Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks
in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and
transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous
efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder
architectures [38, 24, 15].
Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output
sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden
states \(h_t\), as a function of the previous hidden state \(h_{t-1}\) and the input for position t. This inherently
sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer
sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved
significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional
computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental
constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.
Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-
tion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in
the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms
are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.
In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead
relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.
The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in
translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.

2 Background
The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU
[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building
block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,
the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows
in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes
it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is
reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due
to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as
described in section 3.2.
Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions
of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been
used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,
textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].
End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-
aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and
language modeling tasks [34].
To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying
entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-
aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate
self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].

3 Model Architecture
Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].
Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations \((x_1, ..., x_n)\) to a sequence
of continuous representations \(z = (z_1, ..., z_n)\). Given z, the decoder then generates an output
sequence \((y_1, ..., y_m)\) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive
[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.

Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.
The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully
connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,
respectively.
3.1
Encoder and Decoder Stacks
Encoder:
The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two
sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-
wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of
the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is
LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer
itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding
layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.
Decoder:
The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two
sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head
attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections
around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention
sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This
masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the
predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.
3.2
Attention
An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,
where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum

首先，标题部分：
# 3.2 Attention
An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.

然后是3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention
We call our particular attention "Scaled Dot-Product Attention" (Figure 2). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.

In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute the matrix of outputs as:
Attention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT
√dk
)V

# 3.2 Attention
An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.

## 3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention
We call our particular attention "Scaled Dot-Product Attention" (Figure 2). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.

In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute the matrix of outputs as:
Attention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT
√dk
)V
(1)

The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of 1/√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.

While for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of dk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1/√dk.

## 3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention
Instead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned linear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional
4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random variables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = Pdk i=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.

<think>Got it, let's tackle this conversion. First, I need to parse the text from page 5 and structure it properly in Markdown.

First, check for headers. The current text starts with "output values..." which is part of the previous context? Wait, no—looking at the provided text for this page:

The first paragraph is "output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure 2."

Then there's a section on Multi-head attention. Then the formula for MultiHead, then the projection matrices definitions.

Then 3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model—this is a subsection header, so we need to format that as ## 3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model

Then the bullet points under that subsection.

Next, 3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks—another subsection header, format as ## 3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks

Then the content about FFN, including the equation (2).

Then 3.4 Embeddings and Softmax—another subsection header, format as ## 3.4 Embeddings and Softmax

Then the content about embeddings and softmax, including sharing weights.

Finally, there's a "5" at the end—probably a page number or section indicator. We'll include that as is.

Now, let's go through each part and format it correctly:

1. The first paragraph about output values:
"output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure 2."

2. Multi-head attention section:
The text starts with "Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend..." So we need to format that as a paragraph, then include the formula for MultiHead.

The formula is:
```
MultiHead(Q, K, V ) = Concat(head1, ..., headh)W O
where headi = Attention(QW Q
i , KW K
i , V W V
i )
```

Then the projection matrices definitions.

3. Subsection 3.2.3:
Header: ## 3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model

Then the bullet points:
- In "encoder-decoder attention" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,
and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every
position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the
typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as
[38, 2, 9].
- The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values
and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the
encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the
encoder.
- Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to
all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward
information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this
inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input
of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.
```

4. Subsection 3.3:
Header: ## 3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks

Then the content about FFN, including the equation (2). The formula is:
```
FFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2
(2)
```

Then the description of dimensionality.

5. Subsection 3.4:
Header: ## 3.4 Embeddings and Softmax

Then the content about embeddings, softmax, sharing weights.

6. The final "5" at the end—just include it as is.

Now, let's put all these parts together in proper Markdown format.</think>
```markdown
output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure 2.

Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.

MultiHead(Q, K, V ) = Concat(head1, ..., headh)W O
where headi = Attention(QW Q
i , KW K
i , V W V
i )
Where the projections are parameter matrices W Q
i
∈Rdmodel×dk, W K
i
∈Rdmodel×dk, W V
i
∈Rdmodel×dv
and W O ∈Rhdv×dmodel.
In this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use
dk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost
is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.

### 3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model
The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:
*   In "encoder-decoder attention" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,
and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every
position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the
typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as
[38, 2, 9].
*   The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values
and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the
encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the
encoder.
*   Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to
all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward
information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this
inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input
of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.

### 3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks
In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully
connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This
consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.
FFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2
(2)
While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters
from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.
The dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality
dff = 2048.

### 3.4 Embeddings and Softmax
Similarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input
tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-
mation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In
our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax
linear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.

<think>Got it, let's tackle this conversion. First, I need to parse the text and structure it according to the requirements.

First, there's Table 1. I need to create a Markdown table with the headers and rows as given.

Then, after the table, there's text about Positional Encoding. I need to preserve that structure.

Next, "Why Self-Attention" section. Need to keep the headings and paragraphs as they are.

Now, let's go step by step:

1. Table 1: Need to extract the table data.

The table headers are:
- Layer Type
- Complexity per Layer
- Sequential Operations
- Maximum Path Length

Rows are:
Self-Attention | O(n² · d) | O(1) | O(1)
Recurrent | O(n · d²) | O(n) | O(n)
Convolutional | O(k · n · d²) | O(1) | O(logk(n))
Self-Attention (restricted) | O(r · n · d) | O(1) | O(n/r)

So the table in Markdown should be:

| Layer Type               | Complexity per Layer       | Sequential Operations | Maximum Path Length |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Self-Attention             | O(n² · d)                      | O(1)                       | O(1)                     |
| Recurrent                    | O(n · d²)                        | O(n)                         | O(n)                      |
| Convolutional               | O(k · n · d²)                  | O(1)                         | O(logk(n))              |
| Self-Attention (restricted) | O(r · n · d)                    | O(1)                         | O(n/r)                   |

2. Then the text about Positional Encoding:

"3.5
Positional Encoding
Since our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the
order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the
tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add "positional encodings" to the input embeddings at the
bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel
as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,
learned and fixed [9].
In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:
PE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)
PE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)
where pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding
corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We
chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by
relative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of
PEpos.
We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two
versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version
because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered
during training."

3. Then "Why Self-Attention" section:

"4
Why Self-Attention
In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-
tional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations
(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden
layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we
consider three desiderata.
One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can
be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.
The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range
dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the
ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to
traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input
and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare
the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the
different layer types.

executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of
computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence"

First, the table. Then the Positional Encoding section (with heading 3.5). Then "Why Self-Attention" with its content.

Also, note the numbering: 3.5 is a subsection, then 4 is another section.

Now, let's write the final Markdown.</think>

3.5 Positional Encoding
Since our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the
order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the
tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add "positional encodings" to the input embeddings at the
bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel
as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,
learned and fixed [9].
In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:
PE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)
PE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)
where pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding
corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We
chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by
relative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of
PEpos.
We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two
versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version
because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered
during training.

4 Why Self-Attention
In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-
tional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations
(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden
layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we
consider three desiderata.
One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can
be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.
The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range
dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the
ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to
traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input
and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare
the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the
different layer types.
As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially
executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of
computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence

length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with
sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece
[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving
very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in
the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum
path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.
A single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output
positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,
or O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths
between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than
recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity
considerably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable
convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,
the approach we take in our model.
As side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions
from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention
heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic
and semantic structure of the sentences.

Training
This section describes the training regime for our models.
5.1
Training Data and Batching
We trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million
sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-
target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT
2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece
vocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training
batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000
target tokens.
5.2
Hardware and Schedule
We trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using
the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We
trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the
bottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps
(3.5 days).
5.3
Optimizer
We used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning
rate over the course of training, according to the formula:
lrate = d−0.5
model · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)
(3)
This corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,
and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used
warmup_steps = 4000.
5.4
Regularization
We employ three types of regularization during training:

Residual Dropout
We apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the sub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of Pdrop = 0.1.

Label Smoothing
During training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵls = 0.1 [36]. This hurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.

6 Results
6.1 Machine Translation
On the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big) in Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0 BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is listed in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model surpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of the competitive models.

On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0, outperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the previous state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used dropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.

For the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which were written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We used beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters were chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during inference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].

Table 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model architectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a model by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained single-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.

6.2 Model Variations
To evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model in different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the 5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.

development set, newstest2013. We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no
checkpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.
In Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,
keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head
attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.
In Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dk hurts model quality. This
suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility
function than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,
bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our
sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical
results to the base model.
6.3
English Constituency Parsing
To evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English
constituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural
constraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence
models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].
We trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the
Penn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,
using the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences
[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens
for the semi-supervised setting.
We performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual
(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters
remained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we

<think>Got it, let's tackle this conversion. First, I need to parse the text from the current page and structure it properly according to the requirements.

First, identify Table 4. The table has columns: Parser, Training, WSJ 23 F1.

Then the rows are as given. After the table, there's text about increasing max output length, beam size, etc.

Then the conclusion section starts with "Conclusion". Then the main text about Transformer, translation tasks, etc.

I need to make sure that tables are formatted correctly with headers. Also, code blocks if any—wait in this text, there's no explicit code block except maybe the URL at the end. But according to requirements, we need to use proper syntax highlighting for code blocks.

Wait, looking at the text: "The code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor." So that's a URL, not code. But maybe we need to wrap it in a code block if it's part of the text.

But according to the requirements, we need to identify code blocks and use proper syntax highlighting. So if there's any code snippet in the text, we need to wrap it.

In this case, after Table 4, there's a paragraph about increasing max output length to input length +300, beam size of 21, α=0.3.

Then the conclusion section starts with "Conclusion". Then the main text about Transformer, translation tasks, etc.

Now, let's structure this:

First, Table 4. Then the paragraph about max output length, beam size, etc.

Then "Conclusion" as a header. Then the text about Transformer, translation tasks, future work, etc.

Now, let's format each part:

increased the maximum output length to input length + 300. We used a beam size of 21 and α = 0.3 for both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.

Then "Conclusion" as a header. Then the text:

In this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention.

For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.

We are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.

The code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor.

Now, I need to ensure that all headers are properly formatted with # for main headings and ## for subheadings. In this case, "Conclusion" is a section header, so we should use ## Conclusion.

Also, check for any code blocks. The URL is part of the text about the code availability. So we can wrap that URL in a code block? Or maybe not, since it's just a link. But according to the requirements, we need to identify code blocks and use proper syntax highlighting.

In this case, there's no explicit code block in the text except maybe the URL. But perhaps we can ignore that and focus on the main content.

Now, putting it all together in Markdown format.</think>

<think>用户现在需要处理提供的文本，将其转换为Markdown格式。首先分析当前页面的内容。

首先，页面标题是“Attention Visualizations”，然后是“Input-Input Layer5”。接下来是一段关于美国政府在2009年后通过新法律使注册或投票过程更困难的文本，然后是<EOS>和<pad>的标记。之后重复了相同的段落结构。

然后是“Figure 3: An example of the attention mechanism following long-distance dependencies in the encoder self-attention in layer 5 of 6. Many of the attention heads attend to a distant dependency of the verb ‘making’, completing the phrase ‘making...more difficult’. Attentions here shown only for the word ‘making’. Different colors represent different heads. Best viewed in color.”
然后是页码13。

现在需要将这段内容转换为Markdown。首先，标题部分“Attention Visualizations”应该是主标题或者子标题？看结构，可能是章节标题。然后是“Input-Input Layer5”，这部分可能是一个标签或者说明。

接下来处理文本段落。注意原文中有重复的句子，可能是示例或注释。然后是Figure 3的描述。

现在组织Markdown结构：

首先，标题“Attention Visualizations”

然后是“Input-Input Layer5”作为子部分？

然后是段落文本，注意原文中的换行和空格。不过需要保持原意。

现在检查是否有代码块、表格等。当前文本中没有表格或代码块，只有文本和图注。

所以最终输出应该包含标题、段落以及Figure 3的描述。注意页码13在最后。

现在整理成Markdown：

<think>Got it, let's tackle this conversion. First, I need to parse the input text and structure it according to the requirements.

First, look at the content. The page starts with "Input-Input Layer5" then a paragraph about law being perfect but application should be just. Then there are repeated lines, and finally Figure 4 description.

Now, structure the Markdown:

- The "Input-Input Layer5" should be a header? Wait, looking at the context from previous page: they had "Figure 3" then a number 13. Now this is page 14.

So the structure for this page:

First, there's "Input-Input Layer5" then a paragraph. Then repeated lines (maybe placeholders), and Figure 4.

Now, let's process each part:

1. "Input-Input Layer5"
   - This could be a header (## Input-Input Layer5). But looking at the original text, it's "Input-Input Layer5" as a line. So we can keep that as is, maybe as a section header.

2. The paragraph: "The Law will never be perfect, but its application should be just - this is what we are missing, in my opinion."

3. Then there are repeated lines (like "Input-Input Layer5" again, then the same paragraph). But those are probably placeholders (like <EOS> and <pad>) from the OCR. So we should ignore those repeated parts because they are duplicates or placeholders.

4. Then Figure 4: "Figure 4: Two attention heads, also in layer 5 of 6, apparently involved in anaphora resolution. Top: Full attentions for head 5. Bottom: Isolated attentions from just the word ‘its’ for attention heads 5 and 6. Note that the attentions are very sharp for this word."

Now, structure all these into Markdown:

- The "Input-Input Layer5" as a header (maybe ## Input-Input Layer5)
- Then the paragraph.
- Then Figure 4 with its description.

Now, check for any code blocks or math. The text doesn't have code blocks or math equations, so we don't need those.

Now, ensure continuity from previous page. The previous page ended with "13" and this is page 14, so we need to maintain the numbering.

Putting it all together:

First, the "Input-Input Layer5" as a header. Then the paragraph. Then Figure 4.

Now, write the Markdown:

```markdown
Input-Input Layer5
The Law will never be perfect, but its application should be just - this is what we are missing, in my opinion.

Figure 4: Two attention heads, also in layer 5 of 6, apparently involved in anaphora resolution. Top: Full attentions for head 5. Bottom: Isolated attentions from just the word ‘its’ for attention heads 5 and 6. Note that the attentions are very sharp for this word.
```

Wait, but in the original text, there were repeated lines (like "Input-Input Layer5" again). But those are probably placeholders, so we should ignore them. The main content is the "Input-Input Layer5" header, then the paragraph, and Figure 4.

Yes, that should be correct.</think>
```markdown
Input-Input Layer5
The Law will never be perfect, but its application should be just - this is what we are missing, in my opinion.

Figure 4: Two attention heads, also in layer 5 of 6, apparently involved in anaphora resolution. Top: Full attentions for head 5. Bottom: Isolated attentions from just the word ‘its’ for attention heads 5 and 6. Note that the attentions are very sharp for this word.
```

<think>Got it, let's tackle this conversion. First, I need to parse the input text and structure it properly according to the requirements.

First, look at the context from previous page. The previous content ended with "yer5" header... So now we have the new text starting with "Input-Input Layer5".

Now, let's process each part:

1. The first paragraph: "The Law will never be perfect, but its application should be just - this is what we are missing, in my opinion."

2. Then there's Figure 5 description and the page number 15.

Now, we need to structure this into Markdown. Let's check the requirements:

- Headers: Use # ## as needed.
- Lists: Not applicable here, it's paragraphs and figures.
- Bold/Italic: None in this text except maybe the figure title, but we need to preserve as is.
- Code blocks: Not applicable here.
- Math: None.

So the main content to convert is:

Input-Input Layer5
The Law will never be perfect, but its application should be just - this is what we are missing, in my opinion.
Figure 5: Many of the attention heads exhibit behaviour that seems related to the structure of the sentence. We give two such examples above, from two different heads from the encoder self-attention at layer 5 of 6. The heads clearly learned to perform different tasks.
15

Now, we need to format this into proper Markdown. Let's structure it:

First, the header "Input-Input Layer5" as a heading? Probably not necessary if it's just text. But looking at the previous context, they had "yer5" header, then paragraph and figure 4. So now for figure 5.

So the structure should be:

- The paragraph under "Input-Input Layer5"
- Then Figure 5 with its description, and the page number.

Now, let's write the Markdown:

First, the text "Input-Input Layer5" as a heading? Maybe not. But in the previous context, they had "yer5" header, then paragraph and figure 4. So now for figure 5.

So the content is:

Input-Input Layer5
The Law will never be perfect, but its application should be just - this is what we are missing, in my opinion.
Figure 5: Many of the attention heads exhibit behaviour that seems related to the structure of the sentence. We give two such examples above, from two different heads from the encoder self-attention at layer 5 of 6. The heads clearly learned to perform different tasks.
15

Now, we need to format this into proper Markdown. Let's check the requirements again:

- Tables: None.
- Code Blocks: None.
- Math: None.
- Structure: Preserve headers, lists, bold/italic. Here we have a heading "Input-Input Layer5" and then the paragraph, followed by Figure 5 description.

So we can structure it as:

# Input-Input Layer5
The Law will never be perfect, but its application should be just - this is what we are missing, in my opinion.

Figure 5: Many of the attention heads exhibit behaviour that seems related to the structure of the sentence. We give two such examples above, from two different heads from the encoder self-attention at layer 5 of 6. The heads clearly learned to perform different tasks.
15

Wait, but the page number is 15. So we need to include that as well.

Now, check if there are any code blocks or math. There aren't. So we can proceed.

Now, ensure that the flow is consistent with page 15. The previous context ended with figure 4 and then this new content for figure 5 on page 15.

So the final output should be as structured above.</think>
